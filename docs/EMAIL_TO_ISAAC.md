Hi Isaac,

I hope you're doing well.

I need full access to the domain management system for astantglobal.com. Specifically, I'll need:

1. **DNS Management Access** – Ability to add, modify, and delete DNS records (TXT, CNAME, MX records)
2. **Domain Registrar Login** – Credentials or delegated access to the registrar dashboard (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, or wherever the domain is hosted)
3. **Current DNS Configuration** – If possible, a screenshot or export of the existing DNS records so I don't disrupt anything currently active

Could you share the login details or add me as an authorized user?

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Best,  
Salman
