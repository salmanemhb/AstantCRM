# TEMPLATE 1: Investor/Partner Outreach (LONG)

**ID:** `jf-investor-outreach-v1`

### Subject
```
Astant Global Management – Invitation & Updates
```

### Full Email Body

```
Good morning [RECIPIENT_NAME],

I'm [SENDER_FIRST_NAME] from Astant Global Management, having recently joined the firm to support global partnerships and expansion initiatives. I'm writing on behalf of Astant's founding team, [RELATIONSHIP_CONTEXT].

I'm pleased to personally extend an early invitation to Astant's first in-person event of 2026, where we will present our upcoming macro quantitative intelligence AI-powered platform and outline our strategy plan for the year. Full program details, including agenda and post-event gathering, will be shared in the coming weeks with your secretary.

The reason for this email is that our founding team has been focused on bringing the company to a fully mature, post-early-stage state before entering a phase of significant scaling. We wanted to personally reconnect and share a few updates on our progress since then.

Last week, Astant was featured in Forbes Italia as one of the top three fastest-growing and high-potential ventures launched within IE's entrepreneurship ecosystem. Astant was the only venture founded by undergraduate alumni, selected from over 2,000 applications through IE's main innovation center pipeline (IE Venture Lab), alongside two other startups founded by ex IE MBA alums, highlighting our commitment to remain at the intersection of quantitative finance and innovation in the age of Gen AI.

You can find the feature here (in Italian, with a screenshot of an English version attached):
https://nextleaders.forbes.it/da-studenti-a-imprenditori/

Regarding our current developments, we are also preparing to launch OpenMacro, our flagship AI-driven super macro intelligence platform, designed to bridge the last gap in finance:

Alpha Decay, the last barrier between institutional capital and retail capital, as well as the possibility of going for a narrow and empty market when the current alternative landscape is saturated with overpriced and unjustified fee structures in a business model that ultimately rewards tradition and not innovation / performance.

A draft of the web app, which is currently under development, is available here: https://openmacro.ai/ (please keep in mind this is far from being the final version).

Our Goal is to demonstrate our product's capabilities and innovative features while directly answering the first question that came up [MEETING_REFERENCE]: Why Astant and not BlackRock or Citadel?

Our leadership understands the seriousness of involving your company as a serious, strategic partner and key player to assess aggressive market penetration, early adoption across EMEA, while fueling our growth, vision and credibility. We've taken the time to address key aspects that have been mentioned as missing in previous meetings.

We would be delighted to invite you to our office this week or the next according to your availability, to meet the founding team and discuss our latest developments as we are currently engaging in our pre-scaling phase.

Our office address is Paseo de la Castellana, 280 (Loom, 1st floor).

We are ready to welcome you, move forward and take Astant to the next level alongside [RECIPIENT_COMPANY]'s advisory.

The team and I are at your disposal if you have any questions. We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

[SENDER_NAME]
